# Mandelbrot Fractals Explorer
Mandelbrot fractals renderer in [your browser](https://erfanio.github.io/mandelbrot/)!  
This project is a vehicle for me to experiment with new technologies that I have always been curious about. I'm using OpenGL —through Pixi.js— to render the infinitely scrolling plane and web workers to parallelise the fractal generation.  
I'm planning on further optimising fractal generation using WebAssembly.
